Project Requirements
====================

Your final project will be a JavaScript web application on a topic of interest to you. You can visit [Programmable Web](http://programmableweb.com) to get different ideas about what types of APIs you'd like to use and how might you integrate them to create a unique experience.

### Requirements

* Use of at least 1 API (or build your own)
* One of the following:
  * Google Maps integration
  * Parse / Firebase (3rd party data storage)
  * Integration of an additional API
  * Writing your own API / use another API
* Use one of the following frameworks/approaches: Angular OR Plain JS/jQuery with client-side templating with Handlebars. Create modules for data access and HTML rendering
* Use of AJAX and promises
* Use of a client-side router. If you aren't using Angular, there are many other client-side routing libraries you can use. You may want to check out Backbone's router.
* At least 5 practical unit tests using Karma and Jasmine and hooked up to Travis CI
* Your project should be styled so that it presents a good user experience and looks organized and professional.
* Code organization
* Overall complexity. It should be more complex than your assignments and midterm project and your APIs should be integrated in some way.

### Project Extras you may want to consider

* [Google Charting API](https://developers.google.com/chart/)
* Real time functionality with Firebase, Pusher, or Socket IO.


### Project Submission

Host your project with one of the following:

1. Hosted on aludra (USC student hosting)
2. Deployed to Heroku

Send a single email containing the following to the TA and myself on the project due date:

1. A link to your project code on Github
2. A link to your hosted project
3. A description of your project in the email body that explains where you fulfilled each requirement. I will use this as my basis for grading. If I miss something and it is not specified in this email, I will not regrade.
