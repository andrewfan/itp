Project Requirements
====================

Your final project will be a JavaScript web application on a topic of interest to you.

### Technical Requirements

* Using Ember.js on the frontend
  * At least 3 routes
  * Use of AJAX and promises
  * 5 practical acceptance tests in Ember
  * 3 practical integration tests (component tests) in Ember
* Using Node.js on the backend (you don't have to use Express)
  * At least 3 API endpoints. These could return data from your database or they could return data from another API, or both!
  * When working with your database, use an ORM. It can be Sequelize or another one you like.
* Your project should be styled so that it presents a good user experience and looks organized and professional.
* Code organization
* Overall complexity and cohesiveness. It should be more complex than your assignments.

### Database Setup

For your Node.js backend, __you will likely need me to set up a database for you__, unless you want to set up and host one yourself. Send me an email when you are ready for it to be set up, or see me after class and I will do it right there. __Don't want until the last minute!__

### Deployment to a Platform as a Service (PaaS)

You will be deploying both the frontend and the backend of your final project to Heroku, which is one option of a Platform as a Service (PaaS). There are several out there. You are free to use another one if you don't want to use Heroku, as long as your project gets hosted from a publicly accessible URL.

To deploy your Ember.js app to Heroku, watch this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OypxYNryRok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OypxYNryRok).

### Continuous Integration with Travis CI

### Submission

Send a single email containing the following to the TA and myself on the project due date:

1. A link to your project code on Github
2. A link to your hosted project (Heroku)
3. A description of your project in the email body that concisely explains where you fulfilled each requirement. I will use this as my basis for grading. If I miss something and it is not specified in this email, I will not regrade.
