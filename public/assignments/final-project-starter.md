### Project Ideas

Here are some project ideas from previous semesters. Some students took the time to learn things outside of class since they had a project they were passionate about. You are not required to do that. There are lots of ideas that involve CRUD. In the end, you'll have an API in Node that interacts with your own database, and your Ember app that consumes this API.

* A CRUD type of application. We'll be learning how to work with databases in Node. There are lots of ways you can go with this. Here are some ideas:
  * An app for managing where you'd like to travel in the world
  * An app for managing your favorite photos
  * A review/recommendation type of site
* Build your own resume app based on templates
* Build your own blog backed by a database
* A social network type of site. One student created one around traveling. People could log in post content, comments, likes, etc.
* Create a UI for managing your images in Dropbox. This involved integrating with the Dropbox API.
* An app that monitored student enrollment. The USC schedule of classes has an API.
