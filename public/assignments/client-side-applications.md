Create an Ember application where you display a list of artists on the route `artists` with the path `/artists` using data from the following endpoint: http://itp-api.herokuapp.com/artists

Clicking on an artist should navigate to the `artists.artist` route with the path `/artists/:id`. This route should load songs for this artist using the following endpoint: http://itp-api.herokuapp.com/artists/4
