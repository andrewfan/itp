Project Starter 1
=================

Create a fresh installation of Laravel and push it up to a repo on Github called `itp405-final-project`. Next, update the `README.md` file and describe what you want to build for your final project and how you will meet the requirements. Questions you want to answer include:

- What is your site about?
- What types of users will visit your site?
- Will they need to create an account?
- What API will you be using?
- What do you think your tables will be?

Once you addressed those questions, write a service class that interacts with the API you've chosen.

### Submission

To submit, send an email to myself and the TA (dongyanc@usc.edu) containing the URL of your Github repo for your project.
