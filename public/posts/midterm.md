Midterm Study Guide
===

The midterm will be a practical where you will answer a few code challenges and questions. Some of the questions will require you typing out a solution, and others may be a simple answer explaining the result of some code. You will use your computer to come up with your solutions and test them out. When you are finished with a question, paste your solution into a file called `lastname_firstname-itp404-2016.md`. Surround each code block with a code fence, like here: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/.

The midterm is open notes, internet, and assignments. You just are NOT allowed to communicate with anyone inside or outside the class.

### What will be covered?

* Array forEach, map, filter, and reduce
* Promises
  * Promise states: resolved, rejected, and pending
  * Promise chaining
* Object literals
  * dot notation vs bracket notation
  * creating properties and methods on objects
* Constructor functions
  * the `new` keyword
  * the `prototype`
  * extending built-in prototypes like `String.prototype`
* JSON
  * accessing properties in a JSON payload using dot notation and bracket notation
* AJAX with jQuery
  * Basic HTTP response codes that we went over in class in the AJAX lecture, and how that works with promises
  * GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
* Client-side templating with Handlebars

There will be no Ember on the midterm since you will be using it for your final project.
